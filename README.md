# RLocusGUI
Tool to learn drawing of root locus diagrams.
I have stopped development of the MATLAB version (see below), and have developed a JavaScript version to make the program more accessible.  
It is available at: https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Root_Locus/RLDraw.html

****MATLAB version below this line****
This is a MATLAB tool that describes the process of creating a root locus diagram by hand for a user supplied transfer function.  Instead of simply creating the locus, it describes how to apply rules to sketch the locus by hand.
